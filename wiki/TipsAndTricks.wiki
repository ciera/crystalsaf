Notice that if your analysis uses the *user output*, you need to manually open the "Crystal Console" view _first_.  You can do so with Windows | Show View | Other... | Crystal | Crystal Console.

= Exceptions = 
If your analysis throws *exceptions your code doesn't catch*, they will abort the current run of your analysis class.  Crystal will not catch these exceptions and instead, they will cause the child Eclipse to open a dialog informing you of an error.  Open the child's "Error Log" view (using Windows | Show View | Error Log) to see information about the exception that was thrown.
